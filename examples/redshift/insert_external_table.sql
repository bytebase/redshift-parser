-- Redshift INSERT into external tables test cases
-- Based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_INSERT_external_table.html

-- Basic INSERT with SELECT from local table
INSERT INTO spectrum.lineitem SELECT * FROM local_lineitem;

-- INSERT into non-partitioned external table
INSERT INTO spectrum.customers 
SELECT customer_id, customer_name, customer_email, signup_date 
FROM staging.new_customers;

-- INSERT with WHERE clause filtering
INSERT INTO spectrum.orders 
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount 
FROM local_orders 
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- INSERT with JOIN between local tables
INSERT INTO spectrum.order_details 
SELECT od.order_id, od.product_id, p.product_name, od.quantity, od.price 
FROM local_order_details od 
JOIN local_products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id;

-- Static partitioning - adding specific partition values
INSERT INTO spectrum.customer 
SELECT name, age, gender, 'May', 28 
FROM local_customer;

-- Static partitioning with multiple partition columns
INSERT INTO spectrum.sales_data 
SELECT product_id, quantity, price, customer_id, '2024', '05', '15' 
FROM daily_sales 
WHERE sale_date = '2024-05-15';

-- Dynamic partitioning - partition values from source data
INSERT INTO spectrum.customer 
SELECT name, age, gender, month, day 
FROM local_customer;

-- Dynamic partitioning with computed partition values
