-- ALTER RLS POLICY with table alias reference
ALTER RLS POLICY qualified_policy USING (orders.customer_id = current_user_id);

    (user_role IN ('admin', 'manager') OR user_id = current_user_id)
    AND status NOT IN ('deleted', 'archived')
    AND created_date >= '2024-01-01'
    AND (region = 'US' OR global_access = true)
);

-- ALTER RLS POLICY with semicolon terminator
ALTER RLS POLICY terminated_policy USING (active = true);

-- Examples that would NOT work in Redshift (commented out as they're not supported):
-- ALTER RLS POLICY policy_name RENAME TO new_policy_name;  -- NOT SUPPORTED
-- ALTER RLS POLICY policy_name OWNER TO new_owner;         -- NOT SUPPORTED
-- ALTER RLS POLICY policy_name WITH CHECK (expression);    -- NOT SUPPORTED

-- Additional test cases for edge cases

-- ALTER RLS POLICY with empty IN list (edge case)
ALTER RLS POLICY empty_in_policy USING (status IN ());

-- ALTER RLS POLICY with single item IN list
ALTER RLS POLICY single_in_policy USING (role IN ('viewer'));

-- ALTER RLS POLICY with deeply nested parentheses
ALTER RLS POLICY nested_parens_policy USING (((((active = true)))));

ALTER RLS POLICY comparison_policy USING (
    col1 = 'value1' 
    AND col2 <> 'value2' 
    AND col3 < 100 
    AND col4 > 50 
    AND col5 <= 200 
    AND col6 >= 10
);

-- ALTER RLS POLICY with != operator (alternative to <>)
ALTER RLS POLICY not_equal_policy USING (status != 'inactive');
